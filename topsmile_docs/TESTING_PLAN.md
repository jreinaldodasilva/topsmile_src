# TopSmile Test Suite Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive test suite plan for the TopSmile dental clinic system, covering backend, frontend, and integration testing to ensure reliability, prevent regressions, and validate functionality.

---

## 1. Backend Testing

### Tools
- Jest
- Supertest (for API endpoint testing)
- mongodb-memory-server (for in-memory MongoDB during tests)
- ts-jest (TypeScript support)

### Test Types
- Unit Tests: For services, utilities, and business logic.
- Integration Tests: For API routes, middleware, and database interactions.

### Test Organization
- `backend/tests/unit/` - Unit tests for services and utilities.
- `backend/tests/integration/` - Integration tests for API routes.

### Key Test Files and Coverage
- `authService.test.ts` - User registration, login, token refresh, logout, password change.
- `patientService.test.ts` - Patient CRUD operations, search, stats, medical history updates.
- `appointmentService.test.ts` - Appointment scheduling, updates, cancellations, reminders.
- `providerService.test.ts` - Provider CRUD and availability.
- `contactService.test.ts` - Contact form submissions and management.
- `formService.test.ts` - Form templates and responses.
- `billingService.test.ts` (if implemented) - Billing flows and invoice generation.
- Route tests using Supertest for all above modules.

---

## 2. Frontend Testing

### Tools
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- @testing-library/jest-dom
- @testing-library/user-event
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

### Test Types
- Component Tests: For UI components and pages.
- Context Tests: For AuthContext, PatientAuthContext, ErrorContext.
- Hook Tests: For custom hooks if any.

### Test Organization
- `src/tests/components/` - Component and page tests.
- `src/tests/contexts/` - Context and hook tests.
- `src/tests/utils/` - Utility function tests.

### Key Test Files and Coverage
- `LoginPage.test.tsx` - Login form behavior, validation, error handling.
- `RegisterPage.test.tsx` - Registration flow.
- `AdminDashboard.test.tsx` - Dashboard stats and widgets.
- `AppointmentCalendar.test.tsx` - Calendar rendering and interactions.
- `PatientManagement.test.tsx` - Patient list, search, CRUD UI.
- `ProviderManagement.test.tsx` - Provider list and details.
- `ContactManagement.test.tsx` - Contact form and list.
- Context tests for authentication flows and error notifications.

---

## 3. Integration / End-to-End Testing

### Tools
- Cypress

### Test Types
- User flows covering critical paths:
  - User login and logout.
  - Appointment scheduling and rescheduling.
  - Patient creation and updates.
  - Billing and invoice generation.
  - Access control and role-based permissions.

### Test Organization
- `cypress/integration/` - E2E test specs.
- `cypress/support/` - Custom commands and utilities.

---

## 4. Test Scripts and Setup

- Add scripts to `package.json` for running tests:
  - `test:backend` - Run backend tests.
  - `test:frontend` - Run frontend tests.
  - `test:e2e` - Run Cypress tests.
  - `test` - Run all tests.

- Setup Jest config for backend and frontend separately.
- Setup MSW for frontend API mocking.
- Setup MongoMemoryServer for backend tests.

---

## 5. Next Steps

- Implement backend unit and integration tests as per plan.
- Implement frontend component and context tests.
- Implement Cypress E2E tests for critical user flows.
- Continuously integrate tests in CI/CD pipeline.

---

This plan ensures thorough coverage of all system components and user scenarios.

Please confirm if you approve this test suite plan so I can proceed with implementation.
