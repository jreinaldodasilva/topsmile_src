 Create a roadmap for implementing improvements, covering your concerns from the highest to the lowest priority. I would also like a roadmap that covers all improvements, implementations and any new features you can suggest.

Thoroughly and meticulously analyse the project code. Our focus here is on the front end, so any modifications should only be made to the front end. Take your time; I want a thorough analysis. When it comes to making implementations, do them one at a time so that I can verify each one before moving on to the next. Divide your answer to avoid exceeding the size limit. 

Thoroughly and meticulously analyze the project code. Take your time; I want a thorough analysis. When there are implementations to be made, let's do them one at a time so that I can verify one implementation before moving on to another. Split your answer to avoid exceeding the allowed size limit.

Split your answer to avoid exceeding the allowed size limit. Before we begin, I need to upload all the front-end and back-end source code. Once I have done so, I will instruct you to begin.
